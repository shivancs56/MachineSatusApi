# 🚀 Machine Status Management System

This project is a **beginner-friendly ASP.NET Core Web API** project that demonstrates how to build a simple backend system to **manage machine status** (Start / Stop).

The goal of this project is to **learn real-world backend development**, including:
- API creation
- Database connection
- Entity Framework Core
- Swagger testing
- GitHub version control

In many factories or industries, machines have two main states:
- Running
- Stopped

This API allows you to:
- Add a machine
- Check machine status
- Start a machine
- Stop a machine

All operations are done using **REST APIs** and tested using **Swagger UI**.
